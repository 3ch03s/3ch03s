## Overview

3CH03S (pronounced "echoes") is an immersive web-based analog horror/sci-fi experience that blurs the line between reality and fiction. The website simulates an interdimensional communication portal where entities from another plane of existence are attempting to establish contact with humans.

## Features

- **CRT/VHS Aesthetic**: Retro computing visuals with television static, glitch effects, and analog distortions
- **Interactive Elements**: User submission forms, discussion areas, and dimensional "breach" catalogs
- **Narrative Experience**: Explore multiple interconnected pages that reveal an evolving story about dimensional contact
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time comment system for users to share their "experiences" and "perceptions"
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across different screen sizes

## Pages

- **THRESHOLD** (index.html): The main entry point into the experience
- **REALITY BREACHES** (phenomena.html): Catalog of interdimensional incidents
- **PHASE RECONSTRUCTIONS** (simulations.html): Guided perceptual experiences
- **OBSERVER LOGS** (logs.html): Records from those who have experienced contact
- **COMMUNE** (contact.html): Direct communication interface with the entities

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with advanced animations and effects)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Firebase Realtime Database (for comment system)

## Design Philosophy

3CH03S embraces the analog horror aesthetic while creating an immersive narrative experience. The design uses:

- Glitch effects and CRT screen simulations
- Cryptic messaging and hidden text
- Interactive elements that reinforce the narrative
- A consistent voice and tone that blends cosmic horror with sci-fi elements
