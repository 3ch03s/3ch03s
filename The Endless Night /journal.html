                        <p>I woke up at exactly 2:17 AM. Something felt wrong. The house was too quiet.</p>
                        <p>Mom and Dad weren't in their room. Tommy wasn't in his. No one is answering their phones.</p>
                        <p>I walked outside. The streetlights were on, but every house was dark. No one anywhere.</p>
                        <p>It's been hours. The sun should have risen by now.</p>
                        <p>I drove around town. The school, the mall, the police station - all empty.</p>
                        <p>I'm back home now. I don't know what to do.</p>

                        <p>Still no sunrise. My watch says it's been 24 hours, but it feels longer.</p>
                        <p>I've been driving around with a flashlight. Found stores still stocked with food.</p> 
                        <p>The power is on, but TV shows nothing but static. Radio too.</p>
                        <p>I've been yelling, honking car horns. Nothing.</p>
                        <p>I swear I saw something move at the edge of my flashlight beam.</p>
                        <p>Probably just a cat or something.</p>
                        <p>I'm going to sleep in the living room with all the lights on.</p>

                        <p>I saw it standing in my neighbor's yard. Tall. Too tall.</p>
                        <p>It was just... watching me. I took a picture but it didn't come out right.</p>
                        <p>Just a black smudge where it was standing.</p>
                        <p>I'm staying inside now. I've boarded up the windows.</p>

                        <p>The town is changing. Streets don't go where they should.</p>
                        <p>I tried to drive to the highway yesterday, but I kept ending up back at the train tracks.</p>
                        <p>The old train tracks. No matter which direction I drove.</p>
                        <p>There's fog now. Thick fog that seems to glow faintly.</p>
                        <p>I've seen more of the shadow people. They stand at a distance, but there are more now.</p>
                        <p>I found writing on my bathroom mirror this morning.</p>
                        <p>It said "CROSS THE TRACKS"</p>

                        <p>I saw something new last night. Blue lights.</p>
                        <p>They hover in the air, like fireflies but bigger and brighter.</p>
                        <p>They don't seem threatening like the shadows.</p>
                        <p>One floated right up to my window. When I put my hand near the glass, it pulsed brighter.</p>
                        <p>It's hard to explain, but it felt like it was trying to communicate.</p>
                        <p>The lights all seem to drift toward the train tracks before disappearing.</p>
                        <p>I think they want me to follow them.</p>

                        <p>The shadow figures have gotten closer. They're at the edge of my yard now.</p> 
                        <p>I can sometimes hear them whispering, but can't make out words.</p>
                        <p>The blue lights came again. This time, they formed an arrow pointing toward the tracks.</p>
                        <p>I've been looking at the stars. They're wrong. Constellations I don't recognize.</p>
                        <p>I found an old map of Millfield in Dad's office. There's a facility marked beyond the tracks.</p>
                        <p>It's not on any modern maps. Dad never mentioned it.</p>

                        <p>But the blue lights have formed a path. A safe passage through them.</p>
                        <p>I'm going to follow it to the train tracks.</p>
                        <p>Whatever is beyond them, it has to be better than slowly waiting to die here.</p>
